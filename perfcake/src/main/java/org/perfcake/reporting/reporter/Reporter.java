/**
 * A contract of Reporter. Reporter takes
 * multiple {@link org.perfcake.reporting.MeasurementUnit Measurement Units} and combines
 * them into a single {@link org.perfcake.reporting.Measurement Measurement}. The core method
 * is {@link #report(MeasurementUnit) report()} that is called each time a new measurement unit is ready.
 * Reporter should not report anything unless it has been started with the {@link #start() start()} method.
 * If it is properly started, it should regularly report to all
 * registered destinations depending on the configured reporting periods. Reporter can assume
 * that {@link org.perfcake.RunInfo RunInfo} has been set before calling
 * the {@link #start() start()} method. It is the pure responsibility of Reporter to publish measurement
 * results to destination in the configured periods. All period types must be supported.
 * For easier development, it is advised to inherit from {@link AbstractReporter} which provides
 * some common functionality including proper results publishing. One should directly implement
 * this interface only when there is a serious reason.
 * Reporter must be thread safe as it can be called from multiple threads at the same time.
