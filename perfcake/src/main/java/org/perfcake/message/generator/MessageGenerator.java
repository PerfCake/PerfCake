/**
 * <p>A definition of contract for all message generators.</p>
 *
 * <p>A message generator controls how many threads are being used to generate the messages, is responsible for creating and submitting
 * {@link org.perfcake.message.generator.SenderTask SenderTasks} and controls the other components involved in the performance test execution.</p>
 *
 * <p>A message generator is the most crucial and complicated component of PerfCake and it is highly recommended to reuse one of existing
 * implementations as they already offer mostly wanted features.</p>
 *
 * <p>The main task of a message generator is to take care of the sending threads, create {@link SenderTask}s as needed and monitor test progress.
 * It is important to properly shutdown the message generation for both time and iteration based test length control. In the case of an iteration based
 * control, a generator must wait for all the messages to be processed. In the case of a time based control, the test stops immediately after the time
 * has elapsed.</p>
 *
 * <p>Each {@link SenderTask} takes a {@link MessageGenerator} instance to be able to notify the parent generator of any errors that might
 * have occurred.</p>
 *
 * <p>When there is a separate message channel used to receive messages, a {@link Correlator} is set to match requests and responses. The {@link Correlator} is also
 * passed to the {@link SenderTask} so it can register sent messages with it.</p>
