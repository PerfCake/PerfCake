/**
 * A contract of message sender. The ultimate goal of a message sender is to send a message (or any other unit of communication work),
 * and possibly receive a response. Any implementation should not do anything but the communication. It should be a pure wrapper of
 * the message exchange layer.
 *
 * {@link #init()} and {@link #close()} methods should be used to establish and close a permanent connection.
 * It is a design consideration of any implementation whether to handle the connection establishment separately (and not measure it),
 * or to open and close a connection with every single request (and make it part of the performance measurement).
 * Most provided implementations (if not all) handle the connection separately as we are really interested only in measuring the message
 * exchange.
 *
 * {@link #preSend} and {@link #postSend} methods are still not part of the performance measurement and can prepare the message for
 * actual sending or handle any cleanup.
 *
 * {@link #send} method must handle just the message exchange. No logging or complex error handling code should be placed here. Therefore
 * we allow any generic exception to be thrown.
